      <ol id="steps">
        <li>
          In a small bowl, whisk your eggs.<br />
          <div class="nerd">
            A well-whisked egg incorporates as much air as possible. <br />Avoid using plastic, as the risidual oil on the surface interacts with the egg.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          If not already liquid, microwave butter in a small bowl for 20-30 seconds or until melted.<br />
          Briskly whisk the egg and butter until it becomes an emulsion.
          <div class="nerd">
            <strong>e-mul-sion</strong>
            noun<br />
            a fine dispersion of minute droplets of one liquid in another in which it is not soluble or miscible.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the milk to your eggs and butter combination and whisk until combined. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large bowl, mix together your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt).
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour the egg, butter and milk mixture over the dry ingredients and gently mix until there are no large lumps.<br />
          <div class="nerd">
            Over-whisking will start to change the flour and make it start to release its gluten, which will make for a less fluffy waffle. <br />
            Small lumps are totally fine and will absorb and be mixed in later in the process.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          Allow your batter to rest for at least 20 minutes.<br />
          <div class="nerd">
            Resting allows the flour to become saturated and 'bloom', making for a much fluffier and more delicious end result.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat your waffle iron to a high heat and lightly grease.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour a generous amount of batter into the center of the waffle iron. It should spread until it's about 1/2 an inch from the edges and close. <br />
          Cook until golden brown and crispy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Immediately after the waffle is done, spread a small amount of butter over the top.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve as soon as possible. <br />
          Garnish as desired.
